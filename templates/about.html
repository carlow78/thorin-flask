   <p>
      The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
      in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
      Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
      Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
      Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
      action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
      leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

         <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
         <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of
            Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799.

         <h3>Filli and Killi</h3>
         <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
